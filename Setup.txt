###Python Client Load Tester Install###
This document is for centos 6.5 only, please use this only as a guide for other platforms and not step by step install


###Packages that need to be installed###
Python 
Python-setuptools
Python-devel
Gcc
GCC-c++
FreeTDS
FreeTDS-Devel
FreeTDS.x86_64
UnixODBC
Samba


After all the packages above are installed here are the next steps

	#Disable SELinux
		nano /etc/sysconfig/selinux
		set line "SELINUX=enabled" to "SELINUX=disabled"
	
	#Use pip to install pyodbc
		pip install pyodbc
	
	#Reboot for SELINUX disabled to take affect

	#Check to make sure Python is version 2.6 or newer but not 3
		python -V
	
	#Run python in verbose mode to make sure ODBC package was installed properyl
		python -v
		then run from the python command prompt >> import python-odbc
		Should not show any errors like "ImportError: No module named pyodbcs"

	#Register FreeTDS in UnixODBC
		nano /etc/odbcinst.ini
		add lines :	
				#Driver for SQL
				[TDS]
				Driver = /usr/local/freetds/lib/libtdsodbc.so
				FileUsage = 1
				Threading = 1

		Note the driver location maybe different pending package updates so you may want to run "sudo dbupdate" then run "locate libtdsodbc.so | grep -i freetds" to get the directory
		From now on in the serversettings.xml file the driver for sql with be referenced by the name in the [] above so in this case DRIVER={TDS}
